#### Improve cypress tests developer workflow ([#{pullRequestId}](https://github.com/shopsys/shopsys/pull/{pullRequestId}))

-   add option to regenerate cypress snapshots as part of the github workflow
    -   if developer makes any change in design or anything somewhat related to change of snapshots the cypress acceptance test in github workflow will fail
    -   they can now add label to the pull request called `regenerate screenshots` and then manually run the job again to switch from acceptance cypress test to base cypress test to generate new set of sreenshots to replace snapshots
    -   new snapshots are automatically pushed to the branch the of the PR
-   adjust test names and format of snapshot names so it is easier to distinguish from one and other when navigating in file explorer to view failed test screenshot or diffs between them
-   fix `get_ip` function in Makefile to get correct display when running GUI tests locally using xQuartz
-   add 0.5% error threshold
-   see #project-base-diff to update your project
